      "We had a great week at this dreamy place. The pool is well thought out, the water was at 31°C and the kids spent hours in. Our host Dimitris was like all of the Cretans we've met: friendly, helpful, honest, and always available and in a good mood. The Vangelis massage is worth a day trip!",

      "We absolutely loved our stay here for our honeymoon! We were lucky enough to enjoy a full week in this magical setting. Kostas and his entire team brought hospitality to the next level and were so communicative and accommodating to any requests we had. We will forever miss waking up to that stunning sunrise. Crete is a really special place and we got to enjoy many areas with our car rental, it’s almost necessary to explore as there aren’t many areas to walk. We hope we can come back one day!",

      "This is one of the nicest Airbnb we ever stayed. The place was very clean, beds were comfortable, and the view was amazing. The pool was the biggest pool I ever saw at an Airbnb. The owner was very responsive and helped us in any way we needed. My wife got a massage and she said it was the best she ever had. I can't imagine you could find a better Airbnb in Crete and if we ever go back we will definitely stay here.",

      "Dimitris was incredibly helpful! Check-in and checkout were super smooth. We also had an accident with a souvenir blanket falling into the pool and Dimitris promptly washed and fixed it! Extremely clean, the outdoor area is incredible- multiple lounging and seating areas, super comfortable, beautiful view. The one drawback is that the highway is a bit close so you hear the cars driving by, but the location is really convenient being close to Heraklion, yet far enough away for a sense of seclusion. Also, there are a ton of great places to drive to eat in the neighborhood.",
